Description

This project is based partly off of your previous project. As the Flask docs so elegantly say, “Something that is untested is broken.” We’re sorry we have been making you all develop broken apps for the entire semester, but you’ll learn how to make actually-functional apps with this project.

This project has most of the functionality of project 4 implemented, excluding profile pictures. The emphasis on this project is testing (and blueprints, to a lesser extent).

Setup

The setup of your API key should be complete from project 3.

Activate your virtual environment (we recommend using the same one you’ve used for other projects, you don’t need a new one). Then to install all necessary packages, run pip3 install -r requirements.txt

For this project we’ll be using the – requests – Flask – Flask-MongoEngine – Flask-WTF – Flask-Bcrypt – Flask-Login – pythondotenv – pytest

libraries

Project

This is the p5/ directory structure

To run this project, stay in the p5/ directory and use the flask run command. This project is run the same way as project 4. The application fully works as it is given.

In __init__.py, apps are now created by calling the create_app() function. Optionally, a test_config parameter can be passed in so that the application will be configured with the desired settings for testing.

We create the db, login_manager, and movie_client objects and initialize them using the init_app() function of these extensions.

Then we register the main blueprint (you’ll change this later) and set a global 404 error handler function.

The configuration is loaded from config.py. Although we don’t have many configuration values for this project, this kind of pattern is the best practice for when your apps might get more complicated and have lots of configuration values.

routes.py

In this file, you’ll notice that there is a main blueprint. This is the blueprint that contains all of the routes, and it was registered to our application in

__init__.py.

You have to reorganize the project to make it more modular. It doesn’t make sense to have the functions concerned with user management side by side with the functions concerned with entering or viewing reviews. So you’ll see that we created two directories that each have a routes.py inside of them. To complete this part of the project, you’ll need to

1. Create blueprints inside of users.routes and movies.routes named users and movies, respectively.

2. Put all user management view functions into the users blueprint. These are:

3. register,

4. login,

5. account,

6. logout

7. Put all other view functions into the movies blueprint. These are:

8. index

9. query_results

10. movie_detail

11. user_detail

12. Rename routes from main.some_route to users.some_route or movies. some_route as appropriate. These changes will need to happen in the template files and in the function bodies as needed.

13. Register these blueprints with the main Flask object.

tests

In the tests/ directory, you’ll notice four files. The conftest.py file is provided with everything fully implemented. We’ll go into detail about how this code works:

@pytest.fixture indicates that the return value of the function will be passed as a parameter to any test_* function that has a parameter with the same name as the function. For example, we create the app fixture and we pass it in as a parameter to the client fixture further down in the code. app() configures the Flask application with custom testing settings, clears the database, pushes an app context, and returns the app.

client() returns a test client for the application

AuthActions consists of convenience methods to help you register, login, and log out of your application. It’s used in auth() below.

auth() is a fixture that provides authentication actions.

The test_factory.py file is provided with implemented tests so you can see how we test that our configuration values are properly set.

You’ll have to implement some tests in test_movies.py and test_users.py.

test_movies.py – Implement test_search_input_validation(client, query, message) with pytest.mark.parametrize – Test that with an empty query, you get the error “This field is required.” – Test that with a very short string, you get the error “Too many results” – Test that with some gibberish (maybe a random string?) you get the error “Movie not found” – Test that with a string that’s too long, you get the error “Field must be between 1 and 100 characters long.” – Implement test_movie_review(client, auth) – A beginning implementation is already provided to check if the movie detail page for the ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ page will show up. The choice of this id is arbitrary, and you can change it to something else if you want. – Register and login – Submit a movie review with a randomly generated string (to make sure that you’re adding a truly unique review) – Test that the review shows up on the page – Test that the review is saved in the database – Implement test_movie_review_redirects(client, movie_id, message) with pytest.mark.parametrize – This test refers to navigating to movies at a certain /movies/&lt;movie_id&gt; url. – Test that with an empty movie_id, you get a status code of 404 and that you see the custom 404 page. – Test that with (1) a movie_id shorter than 9 characters, (2) a movie_id exactly 9 characters (but an invalid id), and (3) a movie_id longer than 9 characters, the request has a status code of 302 and the error message “Incorrect IMDb ID” is displayed on the page you’re redirected to. –

Implement test_movie_review_input_validation(client, auth, comment, message) with pytest.mark.parametrize – This test checks whether the proper validation errors from MovieReviewForm are raised when you provide incorrect input. – Test that with an empty string, you get the error “This field is required” – Test that with (1) a string shorter than 5 characters and (2) a string longer than 500 characters, you get the error “Field must be between 5 and 500 characters long.” – Hint: ‘a’ * 10 == ‘aaaaaaaaaa’ – You can use any movie id here, just make sure it’s valid or your test will fail.

test_users.py – Implement test_login_input_validation(auth, username, password, message) with

pytest.mark.parametrize – Test that if you try to log in with an empty (1) username or (2) password, you get the error “This field is required” – Test that when you successfully register but have (1) a bad username or (2) a bad password, you get the error message “Login failed. Check your username and/or password” – Implement test_logout(client, auth) – Register, login, check that you successfully logged in, and then logout, and check that you successfully logged out – Implement test_change_username(client, auth) – Test that the account page loads successfully and that you can successfully change the username of the logged-in user. – Test that the new username shows up on the account page

– Test that the new username change is reflected in the database – Implement test_change_username_taken(client, auth) – Test that if we try to change the username to a different user’s username, then we get the error message “That username is already taken” – Implement

test_change_username_input_validation(client, auth, new_username) – Test that if we pass in an empty string, we get the error “This field is required.” – Test that if we pass in a string that’s too long, we get the error “Field must be between 1 and 40 characters long.”

There are a total of 21 tests. Each case in the input validation tests counts as a different test.

For the input validation tests, you have to figure out what to put inside the function. Then you can adjust the parameters being passed in according to the specifications above, and you will cover all cases for validating that input!

Testing

blueprints

Try to perform all of the usual functions on the website, such as registration, login, going to your account, changing your username, performing movie queries, posting reviews, going into your user detail page, etc. Also try navigating to the account page when you’re not logged in, or try some other bad actions to make sure that your blueprints are working.

If you implement the tests part of the project first, you can probably avoid checking that your blueprints are correct manually.

tests

Make sure you’ve covered every test case as detailed above. When you’re in the p5/ directory, run python -m pytest.

This will say “4 failed, 9 passed, 5 skipped” when you start your project. By the end, it should be “30 passed”.

Submission

For submission, submit the zipped p5/ directory. The directory, along with its contents, should be zipped, not the contents of the directory. In other words, when we unzip your file, we should see the p5/ directory. If you have any questions on how to submit, please contact us.

Also make sure that you don’t include your virtual environment in the submission. It makes your submissions much larger, and we don’t need them in order to grade.

Grading

If you don’t use MongoDB or don’t use the packages mentioned in Setup, then you will get a zero on this project.

This will be graded on (1) correctness and (2) robustness

You will have to implement 21 tests. There will be 30 tests in total and each will be worth 5 points for a total of 150 points for writing tests. 45 of these points are given in the tests that were already passing when you got this project.

Every test that passes gives you 5 points.

For blueprints, you will get – 5 points for creating each blueprint (2 total) – 5 points for correctly separating each of the 8 functions into the two blueprints. If we get an error related to your view functions being improperly configured in the blueprints, then you’ll lose points.

In total, there are 200 points.

Robustness:

Refer to the syllabus for the robustness requirement for all projects. The syllabus has been updated with this information, since it will be common to all projects.
